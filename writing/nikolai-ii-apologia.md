# Apologia for Nikolai II

![](./images/nikolai-ii/nikolai-ii.png)

I was inspired to write a defense of the final Romanov emperor (who was then going by the original imperial title Tsar once more) Nikolai Aleksandrovich Romanov-- crowned Nikolai II-- upon finishing Sebastian Sebag Montefiore's grand-scale biography of the royal family. Montefiore ended his book with the following quote, supposedly from current-president of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin among peers at his [Novo-Ogareva residence](https://nedvijdom.ru/srar-house/rezidentsiya-prezidenta_rossii.html#i):

> The greatest criminals in our history are the were those weaklings who threw power on the floor-- Nikolai II and Mikhail Gorbechev-- who allowed power to be picked up by hysterics and madmen.

After reading that (it turns out, quite frequently cited quotation<sup>[[1](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/inside-the-court-of-president-putin-no-extravagance-only-loneliness-hd609sdqdwq)][[2](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2015/03/18/putin-a-soviet-leader-for-the-21st-century-a44889)]</sup>) I was compelled to find the source of that quotation. Unmentioned in <i>The Romanovs</i>: the source of that quote is a 2014 Newsweek article by Ben Judah who cites an unnamed source called 'the Court Interpreter.'<sup>[[1](https://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/01/behind-scenes-putins-court-private-habits-latter-day-dictator-260640.html)]</sup> I suppose calling into question the validity of that quortation would be in bad taste, as this is not really supposed to be about the source of the idea but rather the idea itself: <i>Should Nikolai II be regarded as a traitor to Russia and a weak leader?</i>

As the title above implies, I believe that answer to be a resounding no.

Nikolai II was an imperfect, bigoted, and occassionally hapless leader. I concede all that. But a traitor? And worse than that, a <i>weak</i> traitor? I beg to difer.
