# <i>Hetoimasia: the empty throne</i>

![](/writing/images/title.jpg)

This repository contains my personal writings on history, contemporary geopolitics, and to a lesser extent theology. My areas of research and knowledge are Russia, from its foundation to the present day, and the Orthodox Christian Church in Russia. More broadly, I study the military history of any region from any time. I apply history in pursuit of a reasonable understanding of the modern world.
