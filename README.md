# <i>Hetoimasia: the empty throne</i>

This repository contains my personal writings on history, theology, and contemporary geopolitics. My areas of research and knowledge are Russia, from its foundation to the present day, and the Orthodox Christian Church. More broadly, I study the military history of any region from any time. I apply history in pursuit of a reasonable understanding of the modern world.
